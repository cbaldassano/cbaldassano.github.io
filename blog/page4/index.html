        Jerry Kaplan&#58; The Law of Artificial Intelligence
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Feb 2015</span>

    <p><img src="/blog/public/kaplan.jpg" alt="Kaplan"></p>

<p>Jerry Kaplan has been an interesting force in the Stanford AI community over the past couple years. He&#39;s been a major player in Silicon Valley since the 80s, was one of the early pioneers of touch-sensitive tablets and online auctions, and wrote a book about his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-A-Silicon-Valley-Adventure/dp/0140257314">1987 pen-based operating system company</a> (which was ahead of its time, unfortunately for the company). Recently, however, he seems to have a new mission of fostering a broader discussion of the history and philosophy of AI, especially on the Stanford campus. He has been giving a number of talks on these topics, and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs22/">taught a class</a> that brought in other AI speakers. </p>

<p>His most recent talk, through the <a href="https://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics">Stanford CodeX center</a>, was partially a plug for his upcoming book, <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300213553">&quot;Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence&quot;</a> but focused specifically on how the legal system should handle the rise of autonomous systems. He draws a distinction between a system being &quot;conscious&quot; (which is far off for machines, and more of a philosophical question) and a system being a &quot;moral agent&quot; that is legally considered as an &quot;artificial person.&quot; Arguably corporations already fall under this definition, since they have rights (e.g. free speech) and can be charged with legal action independently from their employees (e.g. in the BP Deepwater Horizon spill).</p>

<p>Can an AI be a moral agent? Jerry argues that systems like autonomous cars are able to predict the consequences of their actions and are in control of those actions (without requiring human approval), so they meet at least a basic definition of moral agency. As has been <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/">discussed by others</a>, self-driving cars will have to make decisions analogous to the philosophical &quot;trolley problem,&quot; in which every possible action results in harm to humans and value judgments must be made. Since AIs can (implicitly or explicitly) have some encoded moral system, they should bear some responsibility for their actions.</p>

<p>He proposed a few ways of actually enforcing this in practice. The simplest would be some type of licensing system, in which every AI system meeting some threshold of complexity would need to be registered with the government. If an AI is misbehaving in some way, such as a driverless taxi driving recklessly fast in hopes of a better tip, then its license would be revoked. The AI might just be destroyed, or if we think that the problem is fixable then it could be &quot;rehabilitated&quot; e.g. with new training data. There are many possible complications here (I asked him about how this would work if the AI is partially distributed in the cloud), but this general approach makes sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy that we&#39;re handing over more and more control to AIs, freeing up humans from mundane tasks and probably outperforming them in many areas (though this will require some restructuring of the economy, which is a topic for another post). There are, however, some very practical problems that we need to address sooner than later - I&#39;m glad to see that technically-minded people like Jerry are diving into these issues.</p>

        Michael Gazzaniga&#58; Tales from Both Sides of the Brain
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2015</span>

    <p><img src="/blog/public/gazzaniga.jpg" alt="Gazzaniga"></p>

<p>Michael Gazzaniga&#39;s new book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tales-Both-Sides-Brain-Neuroscience/dp/0062228803">Tales from Both Sides of the Brain: A Life in Neuroscience</a>, which is a memoir about his scientific study of split-brain patients. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with this work, people who have had their two brain hemispheres surgically separated (for medical reasons) show some <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-split-brain-a-tale-of-two-halves-1.10213">amazingly interesting behaviors</a>, which raise deep questions about consciousness and free will. Gazzaniga set out to simply write a standard popular science book about his research, but ended up publishing a much more autobiographical book that discusses the actual process of scientific discovery. As he writes in the preface:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most attempts at capturing the history of a scientific saga describe the seemingly ordered and logical way an idea developed... I want to present a different picture: science carried out in friendship, where discoveries are deeply embedded in the social relations of people from all walks of life. It is a wonderful way of life, spending one&#39;s years with smart people, puzzling over the mysteries and surprises of nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fact of scientific research that isn&#39;t often highlighted - personalities and relationships are central to the scientific community, even though it rarely looks that way to the public.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of the main takeaways from the talk for me was how young the field of neuroscience is, compared to most other hard sciences. Gazzaniga started his work in the early 1960s, when <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60224-0/fulltext">the term &quot;neuroscience&quot; barely even existed</a>. The fact that the founders of the field are still around should remind us that neuroscience is in its infancy, and we still know very little. Instead of being depressing, it&#39;s kind of liberating - it means that most of the big ideas and unifying theories are still out there to be discovered, and we should take everything we &quot;know&quot; so far with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Gazzaniga said that when he started at Caltech, there were basically two rules:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Do important things: don&#39;t do an experiment just because it&#39;s a new thing to try.</li>
<li>If it&#39;s important, just do it: don&#39;t spend too much time planning and worrying about exactly the right way to test something. In my experience, it&#39;s often hard to even tell ahead of time what the hard parts are going to be, and trying things out is a must faster way to make the experiment better.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the early state of the field, neuroscientists should take these to heart. We&#39;re still looking for the big principles of the brain and mind. Now is not the time to be polishing up the details of our models - we&#39;re still brainstorming.</p>

</div>

<p>I&#39;m a soon-to-be PhD who has spent the last few years at the intersection of machine learning (i.e. building systems to model complex data) and human neuroscience (i.e. trying to collect data on a complex system). I believe that both of these fields are going to have a profound impact in the coming decades, in terms of how we interact with technology, how we communicate, and how we see ourselves. In contrast to my <a href="http://www.chrisbaldassano.com">published papers</a>, in which I have to actually support my points with hard evidence, this blog is an opportunity to speculate about where we are and what&#39;s coming next.</p>
