        <div class="l two-third">
          I study how the human brain is able to perceive and remember our complex real-world experiences. How can we so quickly understand high-level properties of our environment, such as where we are and which actions we can take next? How do we break up our lives into events that we can understand and later recall as stories? Functional MRI, along with new analysis tools, have started to give us insight into the structure of the brain networks underlying these processes. <br><br>
          I am currently a postdoctoral associate at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, working with <a href="http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/hasson/">Uri Hasson</a> and <a href="http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/norman/index.php">Ken Norman</a>. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Stanford in 2015 (advised by <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/">Fei-Fei Li</a> and co-advised by <a href="http://beckman.illinois.edu/directory/person/dmbeck">Diane Beck</a>). As an undergraduate I majored in Electrical Engineering at Princeton, with certificates in Physics, and Robotics and Intelligent Systems.
          I've had summer jobs as a software developer and research intern at a number of companies, including Google, <a href="http://www.acrin.org/">American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN)</a>, and <a href="http://www.kns.com/en-us/Pages/Home.aspx">Kulicke &amp; Soffa</a>.<br><br>

          Starting July 2018, I will be joining the Columbia Psychology department as an assistant professor. The website for the Dynamic Perception and Memory Lab is <a href="http://dpmlab.org"> now online!</a>

          My wife Linda and I began dating in high school in 2004, and were married in 2010. Our children Will and Andrew were born in 2012 and 2016. We all enjoy spicy food, dancing, fancy cheese, Disney movies, and bike riding.
